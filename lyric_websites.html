            <p>Hey!!</p>
            <p>Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel</p>
            <p>Love your imperfections, every angle</p>
            <p>Tomorrow comes and goes before you know</p>
            <p>So I just had to let you know</p>
            <p>The way that Gucci look on you amazing</p>
            <p>But nothing can compare to when you're naked</p>
            <p>Now a backwood and some Henny got you faded</p>
            <p>Saying you the one for me, I need to face it</p>
            <p>Started when we were younger</p>
            <p>Swear to God that I loved her</p>
            <p>Sorry that your mom found out</p>    
            <p>Guess that we just really had the thunder</p>
            <p>Ain't nobody else that I'd be under</p>
            <p>Beautiful, beautiful life right now</p>
            <p>Beautiful, beautiful night right now
            <p>No no nooooo</p></p>
